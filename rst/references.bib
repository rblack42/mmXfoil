abstract="Calculation procedures for viscous/inviscid analysis and mixed-inverse design of subcritical airfoils are presented. An inviscid linear-vorticity panel method with a Karman-Tsien compressiblity correction is developed for direct and mixed-inverse modes. Source distributions superimposed on the airfoil and wake permit modeling of viscous layer influence on the potential flow. A two-equation lagged dissipation integral method is used to represent the viscous layers. Both laminar and turbulent layers are treated, with an e9-type amplification formulation determinining the transition point. The boundary layer and transition equations are solved simultaneously with the inviscid flowfield by a global Newton method. The procedure is especially suitable for rapid analysis of low Reynolds number airfoil flows with transitional separation bubbles. Surface pressure distributions and entire polars are calculated and compared with experimental data. Design procedure examples are also presented.",
